Having their race forged by the god Moradin, they were taught of the benefits of hard labor, perfection in their works, and the importance of their clans. Dwarves live their long lives with a spirit of good and justice, that may only be corrupted by greed. Their sturdiness allows them to be more resistant than other classes in combat as well as resist poison. They tend to vary depending of the place they are from:</p>

                                                        natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven
                                                        refinement.</p>
                                                    <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
                                                    <p>Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age
                                                        as
                                                        humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond

                                                        growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims
                                                        adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
                                                        to be
                                                        750 years old.</p>
                                                    <p>Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self‑expression, so
                                                        they
                                                        lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value
                                                        and
                                                        protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more
                                                        often good than not.</p>
                                                    <p>Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have
                                                        slender
                                                        builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
                                                    <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
                                                    <p>Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you
                                                        have
                                                        superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
                                                        light
                                                        within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
                                                        darkness as
                                                        if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
                                                        shades of gray.</p>
                                                    <p>Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
                                                    <p>Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being
                                                        charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
                                                    <p>Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
                                                        remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for
                                                        such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream
                                                        after
                                                        a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have
                                                        become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in
                                                        this
                                                        way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of
                                                        sleep.</p>

                                                        is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven

                                                        other type is more common and more friendly, and often
