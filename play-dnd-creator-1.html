                                                <p class="card-text font-VT323">Your dwarf character has an assortment
                                                    of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>
                                                <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2.
                                                    Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re
                                                    considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they
                                                    live about 350 years.</p>
                                                <p>Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits
                                                    of a well‑ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a
                                                    strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to
                                                    share in the benefits of a just order.</p>
                                                <p>Size. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150
                                                    pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
                                                <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced
                                                by wearing heavy armor.</p>
                                                <p>Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision
                                                    in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet
                                                    of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
                                                    light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                                                <p>Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against
                                                    poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>
                                                <p>Dwarven Combat Training. You have proficiency with the battleaxe,
                                                handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.</p>
                                                <p>Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of
                                                    your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>
                                                <p>Stonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check
                                                    related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in
                                                    the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the
                                                    check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>
                                                Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.
                                                <p>Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those
                                                    characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf
                                                    might speak.</p>
                                                Hill Dwarf
                                                <p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and
                                                    remarkable resilience.</p>
                                                <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
                                                <p>Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it
                                                    increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>

                                                    natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven
                                                    refinement.</p>
                                                <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
                                                <p>Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as
                                                    humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical
                                                    growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims
                                                    adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be
                                                    750 years old.</p>
                                                <p>Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self‑expression, so they
                                                    lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and
                                                    protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more
                                                    often good than not.</p>
                                                <p>Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender

                                                <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
                                                <p>Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have
                                                    superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light
                                                    within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
                                                    if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
                                                    shades of gray.</p>
                                                <p>Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
                                                <p>Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being
                                                charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
                                                <p>Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
                                                    remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for
                                                    such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after
                                                    a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have
                                                    become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
                                                    way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of
                                                    sleep.</p>
                                                <p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish
                                                    is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven
                                                    literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous
                                                    among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
                                                    Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

                                                <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the
                                                    basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds
                                                    of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing
                                                    themselves to be superior to non‑elves and even other elves. The
                                                    other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered
                                                    among humans and other races.</p>
                                                <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
                                                <p>Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword,
                                                    shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
                                                <p>Cantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell
                                                    list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
                                                    Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of
                                                    your choice.</p>

                                                    <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
                                                <p>Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.</p>
                                                <p>Alignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good‑hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.</p>
                                                <p>Size. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
                                                <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
                                                <p>Lucky. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>
                                                <p>Brave. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
                                                <p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</p>
                                                    Lightfoot
                                                <p>As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.</p>
                                                <p>Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.</p>
                                                <p>Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
