                                                        Those might be the best words to describe a dwarf. Having their

                                                        their clans. Dwarves live their long lives with a spirit of good
                                                        and justice, that may only be corrupted by greed. Their
                                                        sturdiness allows them to be more resistant than other classes
                                                        in combat as well as resist poison. They tend to vary depending

                                                        The
                                                        Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share

                                                    <p>Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and
                                                        often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.</p>
