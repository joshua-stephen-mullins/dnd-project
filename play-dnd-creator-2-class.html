                        doing
                        stuff without getting seen. Opening locked doors, chests or mechanisms, stealing invaluable
                        artifacts, and climbing walls to access places you shouldn’t be into are just a few things they
                        are
                        able to do in the blink of an eye.</p>

                        Due to some random or pre-established occurrence, magic runs through you. This means you can
                        “cheat”
                        in a certain way to be able to use magic at will, instead of having to learn how to cast it.
                        Sorcerers are also equipped with a pool of magic they get their sorcery points from, letting
                        them
                        twist spells to their will in different ways.

                        Draconic Bloodline (PHB)
                        Draconic blood runs through your veins. Depending which type of dragon it is you will be able to
                        improve your spells associated with it. Moreover, dragon scales partly cover your skin, making
                        you
                        more resistant do damage.</p>

                        Warlocks make pacts with extremely powerful beings, who don’t mind lending some power as they
                        have
                        so much they don’t even notice. However, it all comes with a price: There’s a reason this entity
                        decided to accept the pact, and you might need to do some stuff to maintain the accord. Decide
                        whether you want to have a big spellbook full of incantations, a strange summonable weapon or
                        weird
                        servants. Will you perish in the way to becoming an eldritch master?

                        The Fiend (PHB)
                        Possibly for some kind of miracle to happen you decided to make a pact with a powerful demon or
                        devil. Fiends don’t really care much about those who make pacts with them. However, they will
                        give
                        you their destructive powers in exchange of some things of their like, such as the player
                        character’s soul.</p>

                        Wizards decide to go in adventures to further their knowledge. The great world in front of them
                        has
                        thousands of spells for you to learn and master. With a spellbook at hand, they will look for or
                        buy
                        them to become a greater spellcaster. Just transcribe them to the book and you’ll understand why
                        wizards are such a versatile class. The amount of spells they can learn greatly surpasses all
                        other
                        classes’ lists.

                        School of Evocation (PHB)
                        Evocation is the school of magic of destruction and explosions. Thunders, fire, acid and more
                        come
                        out from your spells. If you were looking for the all-powerful destructive wizards, this is your
                        best choice! Don’t worry that much about your allies, you can always shape your spells a bit so
                        they
                        don’t receive as much damage.</p>
